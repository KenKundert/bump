    pip3 install .

To create initial version of configuration file:

    bump initialize

Configuration file is .bump.cfg.

Set initial values for version number components.
Indicate which variables should be updated when date and version numbers change.

A typical configuration file looks like::

    date_fmt = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    major = 1
    minor = 6
    patch = 1
    date = ['bump __released__']
    version = ['bump __version__', 'setup.py version']

The strings in date and version are split once with the first piece being a file 
name and the second being the name of the variable within that file.

To run:
    bump patch
    bump minor
    bump major
